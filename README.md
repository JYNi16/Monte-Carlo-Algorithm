# Monte-Carlo-Algorithm

This Project include Monte-Carlo simulation for various spin models:

(1) 2D-Ising model 

(2) 2D XY model 

(3) 2D XXZ model 

(4) Heisenberg model

In addition, different algorithms are implemented, including:

(1) metropolics (single-flip method) (2) Wolff cluster method 

Above simulation coded by fortran, python and C++
